### Information Radiator Write-Up (5 pts)

In the lecture on information radiators, I argued that modern businesses following Agile and Lean methodologies (such as the "Lean Startup" approach) are in need of good measurements that will allow them to test hypotheses about customers, features, marketing, sales, usage, and growth. You can help your client by building in metrics to your product.  

In this assignment, you will propose a new "feature" or addition to your project in the latter cateogory: something that would give them valuable learning as they develop and use their new software. Write a proposal for a way to acquire or re-use data that will be of some business value. Tell us what the benefit to the client will be, and how feasible it is to build the measurement/analysis functions into the product. How would you do it, and where would the code go? 

This is a hypothetical; you don't actually have to build your proposed mechanism into the product.  But it should be a well-reasoned proposal so that the client can consider it and decide whether they want to add it to the product backlog.

For full credit:

- Describe the “output”, i.e., what’s the measurement, statistic, or data visualization that you propose to provide?
- Discuss the implementation. Would it be a simple SQL query? Require new software or new code? Require a re-design or re-architecture of the program? Estimate the time and resources it would take.
- Commit the proposal to your team's GitHub repo by midnight on the due date.  You may want to create a sub-folder for these, so I can find them.  Make sure your proposal is different from those of your teammates.

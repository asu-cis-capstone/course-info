###IT Profession Scavenger Hunt

The purpose of this challenge is to help you transition from your student role into becoming a member of an IT/IS profession. A "profession" is not just your job; it refers to the "community of practice" of people who do the same sorts of work across companies and industries, who share a common jargon, ways of thinking and communicating, standards, ethics, rituals, and so on.  Therefore I want you to get out and circulate among people who are doing work in the field.

Over the course of the semester, attend three professional meetups or user group meetings.  There are dozens of these meetings on technology and business topics in the Phoenix area.  For each one, write a couple of paragraphs about what the group was, where and when, what the speaker topic was, and your general impressions of the meeting.  Tell us if you'd recommend this group for other students.  Submit these write-ups via Blackboard (1 file, 3 files, whatever works).

I recommend you bring business cards, network, and just see who you meet and what you learn.  Now you have a real project to talk about, so talk about it!

Here's a list of meetups that I know about:

- Phoenix Scrum Users Group (http://phxsug.org)
    - North Group meets 1st Tuesday of each month at Axosoft in Scottsdale

#### Policies & Exceptions

I have been asked to make a couple of policies for other types of events.  This is what I've decided:

- Training sessions at work, or provided by vendors, do *not* count.
- Attending a professional conference may count for one of your required visits *per day of the conference* provided you attend sessions each day.  If it's a three-day conference, write about three of the sessions you attended and that will satisfy the requirement.
- **Desert Code Camp** on Saturday, October 18, is a free, one-day conference for all kinds of techies in the Phoenix area.  I like it so much, I'll let you count *two* of the sessions toward this assignment even though they're on the same day. See: http://oct2014.desertcodecamp.com/home

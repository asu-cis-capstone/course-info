### Assignments for CIS 440

Click on the files in this directory for more information.  This is a brief overview only.

- Information Radiator Write-Up (5 pts)
    - We will be talking about empirical feedback loops in your product and process.  For this assignment you'll generate an idea or proposal for something your client might want you to build into the product, that will give him data feedback on the product, its users, or his business.

- IT Profession Scavenger Hunt (15 pts)
    - Attend three meetings of professional meetups or user groups.  There are dozens of these meetings on technology and business topics in the Phoenix area.  For each one, write a couple of paragraphs about what the group was, where and when, what the speaker topic was, and your general impressions of the meeting.  5 points each.
    
- Personal Project (8 pts)
    - You'll develop a small personal project, maybe a website, which demonstrates something new you've learned during this course.  Post it to GitHub and include a README file that tells me what's new about it.  Team or client didn't like your idea for a bright pink CSS theme or an animated talking paper clip?  Here's where you can show off your individuality.
    
- Tech Talk (8pts)
    - In small groups (not necessarily your project team) you'll investigate some new tool or technique that may be useful on your projects, and give the class a short talk and demonstration.  I'll provide a schedule for sign-ups soon.
    
- Releases 0.1-0.6 (5 pts each)
    - You will release to the `master` branch of your repository a new, working version of your product.  This should be the version you demonstrate in class on the corresponding "demo day".  Make a tagged commit on `master` so that I can easily compare releases.  See the [Git-flow model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for an idea of what I'm expecting.
    - In releases 0.4-0.5, your release will include tests and test documents.
    - In releases 0.6-1.0, your release will include continuous integration artifacts.
    
- Backlog updates 0.1-0.6 (5 pts each)
    - We'll use the README file in your GitHub repo to communicate the product backlog.  That way, I can compare releases and see how the backlog has changed over time.  Create a heading called **TO-DO** and list your upcoming backlog items in priority order, with sub-tasks if defined.  I will give guidelines for README-driven development soon.
    - In releases 0.4-0.5, you'll include burndown charts.
    - In releases 0.6-1.0, you'll have a project website.
    
- Capstone Project Showcase (8 pts)
    - For the final "demo day", the public will be invited.  You'll set up a table (like an expo or science fair) to demo your project to faculty, students, and friends of the department.  You'll want to dress professionally and make a good impression.

- Capstone Project Report (10 pts)
    - Here I'm looking for a 20+ page report which tells the story of your project.  It will include sections on the client, the team, the problem, the solution, installation guidelines, instruction manual, and you can round it out with design documents (database schema, etc), screenshots, and more.  The goal is a "success story" that you can show at job interviews and I can show to future potential CIS440 clients, as well as a "history" of this class.  It will need to be professionally written and edited with an executive summary, table of contents, references, and appendixes if necessary.

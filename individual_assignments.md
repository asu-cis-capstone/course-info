#CIS440 Non-Project Assignments
These are guidelines for the two non-project homework assignments on the syllabus.  This is a first draft and may be revised.

##IS Profession Scavenger Hunt (15pts, April 21)
The purpose of this assignment is to help you transition from your student role into becoming a member of an IT/IS profession.  A "profession" is not just your job; it refers to the "community of practice" of people who do the same sorts of work across companies and industries, who share a common jargon, ways of thinking and communicating, standards, ethics, rituals, and so on. Therefore, the task requires you to get out and circulate among people who are doing work in the field.  You will be networking, learning about other people's work and maybe talking about your own.

Find a container -- a manila envelope, potato sack, cigar box, or something -- and gather in it the following materials:

- one of your own business cards (or a "proof" of a business card design)
- an IT-related cartoon that you think i'll enjoy
- print your github.com/yourname page
    - show "1 month" of contribution activity
    - it should have a picture and some activity visible throughout the semester
- piece of swag (or photo of self with piece of swag) from an IT vendor
- 3 non-trivial contributions to open-source projects other than your own -- print screenshots of the "blame" pages so I can see what you did
- "selfies" taken at 3 professional meetups or user groups, with notes on the date, location, group, speaker, meeting topic, and what you gained from each (e.g. contacts made, or something learned)

Deliver the completed scavenger hunt materials to me by April 21 for grading.  You can have your items and container back after I grade them during finals week.

Some more information about the final requirement.  Professional and technology groups are going on all the time in the Phoenix area.  Typically these are evening meetings held once a month on a specific topic, usually with networking time, food and drinks, and an invited speaker.  Search for the "______ user group" where the blank is any particular technology or business topic you're interested in, or try browsing meetup.com.  Some of the ones I know about are listed here:

- Phoenix Scrum Users Group (http://phxsug.org)
    - North Group meets 1st Tuesday of each month at Axosoft in Scottsdale
    - South Group meets 3rd Thursday of each month at Infusionsoft in Chandler
- Project Management Institute (http://www.phx-pmi.org/)
    - North Group meets Oct. 15, Nov 19
    - South Group meets Oct. 16, Nov 20
    - Several other events on calendar
- The Arizona Software Community (http://www.meetup.com/azsoftcom/)
- Arizona SQL Server User Group (AZSSUG) (http://www.meetup.com/arizona-sql-server-user-group/)
- Big Data Developers in Phoenix (http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/)

I have been asked to make a couple of policies for other types of events.  This is what I've decided:

- Training sessions at work, or provided by vendors, do *not* count.
- Webinars or other recorded presentations (such as online classes) do *not* count.
- Attending a professional conference may count for one of your required visits *per day of the conference* provided you attend sessions each day.
- **Desert Code Camp** in April (not yet scheduled) is a free, one-day conference for all kinds of techies in the Phoenix area.  I like it so much, I'll let you count *three* of the sessions toward this assignment even though they're on the same day, as long as you attend three sessions. See: http://desertcodecamp.com/about

##Tech Talk (10pts, various due dates)
In small groups (not necessarily your project team) you'll investigate some new tool or technique that may be useful on your projects, and give the class a short talk and demonstration. I'll provide details and a schedule for sign-ups soon.

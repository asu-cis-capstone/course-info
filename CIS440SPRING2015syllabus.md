####Course Description and Objectives

CIS 440 is the capstone course for the CIS undergraduate program.  Over the fifteen weeks of the course, you and your classmates will work in self-organizing teams to complete IT projects that deliver tangible value to real organizations.  You will apply the breadth of knowledge that you have acquired through earlier CIS coursework, interships, and work experience, and learn new skills on-the-job.  

In addition, through lectures and readings, I will offer you an operational, managerial, perhaps even entrepreneurial perspective on the work of information systems development: not "how to program" (anyone can learn that!), but rather, "how to design the best processes for producing high-quality software".  This will include a look at project management approaches--traditional and agile--but will also include modern engineering practices, DevOps, and continuous delivery.

At the end of this course, you should be able to:

- work as a member of an agile IS development team using Scrum;
- effectively leverage a version control system (Git/GitHub) for collaboration;
- plan software quality assurance activities for validation and verification;
- set up development operations (DevOps) using the cloud;
- demonstrate the ability to learn new tools and techniques when needed; and
- show off a completed Capstone project as part of your professional portfolio.

This course and the capstone project are the final milestones of your CIS degree program and you are expected to put forth a great deal of effort.  You will need to dedicate a significant amount of outside time for homework, project work, and meetings with your team and your clients.

####Email/Online Communication 
One of my jobs is to help you deal with obstacles and get the resources or help you need to succeed in this projects, so I encourage you to stay in communication with me.  When e-mailing me, please indicate in the subject line that it is for CIS 440 and which section you are in.  Be sure to sign it with your full name, and state your problem clearly.  You can expect me to check my e-mail at the beginning and end of the work day, but not necessarily on weekends or at night.  If you think you’ll need urgent help outside of the work week, let me know in advance.


####Examinations 
There is one final exam at the end of the course:
- CIS Critical Skills Assessment:  There are several skills that are critical and foundational to the discipline of Information Systems and the practices of systems analysis and design, and mastery of these skills is our expectation for anyone possessing a degree certifying completion of a BS in Computer Information Systems from the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.  To assure mastery of these skills, students will be given a skills assessment exam wherein they are presented with a business case study and expected to answer a series of questions that assess their level of competence with:
    - Identification of business information systems requirements and proposal of appropriate information systems solutions.
    - Using established methodologies for analysis and design of proposed solutions.
    - Selecting an appropriate project management methodology, explaining the critical issues and uncertainties that will determine project success, and communicating these issues in business terms.

NOTE: This material is not an exam based only on CIS440 material, but instead is meant to evaluate the skills you have learned from the entire CIS undergraduate program.  You may bring any books or other references that you wish.
	
####Group Policies 
You will form groups of four to six members for the course project.  It is important to be professional when dealing with the client, and to make sure you are working well with your teammates.  When forming teams, it is *strongly* recommended that you communicate frankly about expectations and identify any potential problems early on.  

A student may be **kicked off the project team** either (1) if the client insists, or (2) if the other teammates unanimously agree to kick him for being disruptive or not contributing to the work, subject to my agreement.  If a student is kicked off his team, I may (at my discretion) propose an alternative project for the student to be able to complete the course.  It will likely be difficult and the grading will be subjective, so I strongly recommend not getting into this situation.  If you do perceive a problem to be developing, ask for help before it is too late.

####Late Work
Most assignments are due at the end of the day on the due date (i.e. midnight).  If I receive them late within the next 7 days, I'll accept them but take 25% off.  I usually don't accept work later than 7 days after the due date.  Work that is due to be delivered during class time (i.e. presentations) cannot be accepted late.  Contact me if you need an accommodation for some kind of emergency.

####Class Attendance and Participation 
Class attendance is necessary to achieve the maximum benefit from this class. You are expected to attend every class. Excessive absences will affect a student’s course grade and/or result in removal from the course.  If a student is unable to attend class for any reason, they should notify the instructor and their teammates as soon as possible by email.  In accordance with ASU policies, accommodations will be made for students observing religious holidays, or missing class related to university-sanctioned activities.  Please let me know as early as possible.
- ASU calendar of religious holidays (sorry, Pastafarians): https://provost.asu.edu/index.php?q=religious-holiday-calendar
- Policy on university-sanctioned activities (ACD 304-02): http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-02.html

####Academic Integrity  
From the ASU General Catalog:  “The highest standards of academic integrity are expected of all students. Failure to meet these standards may result in suspension or expulsion from the university and other sanctions as specified in the academic integrity policies of the individual colleges.”  By law and regulation, this course will be conducted within the ethical standards of ASU at large, which preclude such activities as plagiarism, cheating, and various forms of harassment.  Statement/policy on these issues:    http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity

####Students with Disabilities
If you wish to request accommodation for a disability, you need to be registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) and provide documentation from the DRC.

####Threatening or Disruptive Behavior
We will follow the ASU Student Services Manual (SSM 104-02) if there are any cases of disruptive, threatening, or violent behavior that arise.  Individuals can be asked to leave the premises or the police may be called in an extreme situation.

####Classroom Etiquette, Professionalism and the Learning Environment
It is an extremely high priority of your instructor that the classroom experience be one that promotes a learning environment for all students present. Students, taxpayers and many other University stakeholders have paid of their money, time and resources to make this classroom environment available to you. There are a variety of behaviors which are violations of classroom etiquette because they (1) distract other students, (2) distract the instructor, and (3) distract the student exhibiting the behavior. In order to assure an environment that promotes learning for everyone present the following behaviors will absolutely not be tolerated:

1. Using your laptop (surfing the web) for anything other than class business.
2. Talking during inappropriate times.
3. Showing up late for class.
4. Doing homework for another class during the normally scheduled class time.
5. Listening and/or viewing audio/video devices during class.

Each instance where a student is found to be in violation of classroom etiquette will cost that student 1% off the total 100% available for the class score. There is no limit to the number of percentage points a student may lose due to these violations.
